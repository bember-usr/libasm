# `🗣️ About`
> The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language.

For detailed information, refer to the [subject](https://github.com/appinha/42cursus/tree/master/_PDFs) of this project.

`🚀 TLDR`: ***this project consists of coding basic functions (see below) in Linux x86-64 Assembly
(Intel syntax), which are then compiled into a library for use in C language code.***

**Mandatory**
```
size_t		ft_strlen(const char *s);
char		*ft_strcpy(char *dst, const char *src);
int		ft_strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);
ssize_t		ft_write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
ssize_t		ft_read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
char		*ft_strdup(const char *s1);
```
